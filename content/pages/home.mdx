### About the repo

You can clone it on GitHub to use it for yourself, and see how it works! I would love if you told me when you do use it, I love seeing variations on it!

The tags at the bottom of the page are dynamically generated. The more tags you use, the more tags are added to the list! Posts are simple markdown files.

You should also check out my newsletter, or my word game Jumblie, or my [GitHub profile](http://localhost:3000). Or don‚Äôt. Follow your dreams. Enjoy!

`console.log("Hello World!");`
