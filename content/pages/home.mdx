### About the repo

You can clone it on [GitHub](https://github.com) to use it for yourself, and see how it works! I would love if you told me when you do use it, I love seeing variations on it!

You should also check out my [site](https://chris.aldred.dev), or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/christopher-aldred). Or don‚Äôt. You do you. Enjoy!
